### SQL Project: Real Estate Dataset Analysis

#### Project Description
This project involved analyzing a comprehensive real estate dataset comprising 22 columns and 6,197 rows. The dataset offers insights into various aspects such as  property types, geographic locations, sales performance metrics, and other critical data points. Key SQL functionalities such as Windows Functions, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), GROUP BY, ORDER BY, SUM, COUNT, and data cleaning techniques were integral to the analysis.

#### Objectives
1. **To Explore the Distribution of Property Types**: The primary objective was to comprehensively understand the composition of the real estate market in terms of property types. By analyzing the distribution of different property types across suburbs and regions, the project aimed to uncover prevalent trends and preferences among buyers.

2. **Determining Top-Performing Sellers**: Another key objective was to evaluate the performance of real estate agents based on key performance indicators such as the number of properties sold. This analysis enabled stakeholders to identify and recognize top-performing agents, facilitating informed decisions for prospective sellers and buyers.

3. **Analyzing the Correlation Between Property Sales and Proximity to CBD**: Understanding the correlation between property sales and proximity to the Central Business District (CBD) was crucial. The objective was to investigate whether properties closer to CBD areas experienced higher sales volumes due to economic activity and attractiveness.

4. **Identifying the Year of Significant Real Estate Market Boom**: The project aimed to pinpoint the year that witnessed the most significant boom in the real estate market. This analysis provided historical context and insights into peak market periods, which are valuable for understanding market cycles and trends.

5. **Identifying High-Demand Areas for Unique Properties**: Lastly, the project aimed to identify areas where properties with building areas exceeding land areas were in high demand. This objective provided insights into unique market preferences and potential investment opportunities in specific geographic locations.

#### Skills and Techniques Used
- **Windows Functions**: Used for calculating running totals, rankings, and other cumulative statistics essential for trend analysis.
- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: Applied to break down complex queries into manageable parts, enhancing query readability and efficiency.
- **GROUP BY and ORDER BY**: Employed to categorize and arrange data for meaningful insights and analysis.
- **Data Cleaning**: Ensured dataset integrity by removing inconsistencies and preparing data for accurate analysis.
- **SUM and COUNT Functions**: Utilized for aggregating numerical data to derive key metrics and performance indicators.

#### Achievements
1. **Top Selling Suburb Identified**: Through the analysis, RESERVOIR emerged as the top-selling suburb, situated in the Northern Metropolitan Region. This discovery provided a deeper understanding that despite the Southern Metropolitan region having the highest overall property sales, the Northern Metropolitan region has specific suburbs with exceptionally high sales volumes.

2. **Real Estate Boom in 2016**: The project highlighted a significant boom in the real estate market in 2016, with a total of 3,483 properties sold. This insight surpassed the subsequent year's sales figures, indicating a peak in market activity during this period.

3. **Proximity to CBD Influences Sales**: Regions closer to the Central Business District (CBD) recorded the highest number of property sales. This correlation underscored the economic attractiveness of CBD areas, where both buying and renting properties for commercial purposes are perceived as lucrative investments.

4. **Performance Analysis of Real Estate Agents**: The project provided insights into the performance of real estate agents based on the number of properties sold. This information proved invaluable for stakeholders seeking reliable agents to ensure a faster sale and better financial deals.

5. **Preferred Property Types Revealed**: Analysis revealed that the "H" type properties (houses, cottages, villas, semi-detached, and terrace properties) were the most preferred across various suburbs. This finding highlighted prevailing buyer preferences and trends in property types.

6. **High-Demand Areas for Unique Properties**: The analysis also identified areas where properties with larger building areas compared to land areas were highly sought after. This insight into unique market preferences helped identify potential investment opportunities and areas of high demand.

These achievements underscore the project's success in delivering actionable insights and strategic recommendations to stakeholders in the real estate industry, enhancing their ability to navigate complex market dynamics and make informed decisions.
